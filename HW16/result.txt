I used one sliders in my app to control the threshold. There are 3 points on the phone screen which represent the center of mass. The default was set to be 100% PWM output for both left and right motors. PWM of motors was changed in order to change direction. When the COM2 was larger than 320, the 
PWM of the right motor was decreased by (COM3-320)/320. When the COM2 was smaller than 320, the PWM of the left motor was decreased by (320-COM3)/320.
